## WAT, Ansible can be even MOAR awesome?!?!

#### Convention over configuration

Ansible loves conventions. Conventions save time.

One of the way Ansible understands conventions is from directory structure.

E.g. All files that we used, had they been in a `files` directory relative to the playbook, we wouldn't have needed to specify the entire path.

Same thing for `templates`.

Now that would more clear as well when you look at the directory.

#### Now that's nice, but Ansible has something that'll rock your minds: Roles

In our scenario, we could easily divide our playbook into two logical parts: 

1. We need Nginx installed and configured
2. We need to deploy our amazing app

In Ansible terms, that's one Playbook, running two Roles:

1. Nginx
2. App, which is dependent on Nginx
